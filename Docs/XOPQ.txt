XOPQ
====


Variation
---------

### Glyphs

- all glyphs with a thick stroke

### Widths

- rule: sidebearings same as default
- no exceptions (?)

### Shape

- internal whitespace (XTRA) does not change in closed glyphs
- in open glyphs, internal whitespace is adjusted to harmonize with widths of closed glyphs

### Anchors

- some anchors are positioned proportionally
- some anchors are attached to contour points

### tapering

- keep tapering in XTRA min? (currently inconsistent)


Workflow
--------

- shift points until measurement snaps
- import default in the background
- isolate parts of contour and scale to match foreground
- reposition foreground points based on scaled curve in the background
